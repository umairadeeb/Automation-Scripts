# Automation-Scripts
This repo contain my scripts I wrote over the years to automate my tasks etc.

So far, these scripts are available to use:

#### AutoTempo.sh
- This script will import your timesheets' worklog to JIRA's TEMPO, taking input from another file.
- Works on Jira version 6.2.6 and Tempo Timesheets version 7.9.1.3
